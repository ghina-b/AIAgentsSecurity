## 🛡️ About This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of research materials on the four critical security gaps in AI systems. Each gap represents a distinct vector of vulnerabilities and challenges that researchers and practitioners must address to build safer AI systems.

### The Four Critical Security Gaps:

1. **Gap 1: Unpredictability of multi-step user inputs** - Challenges in anticipating complex sequences of user interactions
2. **Gap 2: Complexity in internal executions** - Vulnerabilities within the AI agent's processing and decision-making
3. **Gap 3: Variability of operational environments** - Security issues arising from diverse deployment contexts
4. **Gap 4: Interactions with untrusted external entities** - Risks from connections with outside systems and networks

## 🔍 Exploring the Gaps

### Gap 1: Unpredictability of multi-step user inputs

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

#### Overview
This gap addresses vulnerabilities arising from complex sequences of user interactions that may exploit AI systems through carefully crafted inputs. Research in this area focuses on detecting and mitigating techniques that manipulate AI behavior through strategically designed prompts or sequences of interactions.

#### Key Sub-Categories:

- **Prompt Injection Attacks**: Materials on techniques that insert malicious instructions into seemingly benign prompts
- **Jailbreak Methods**: Research on bypassing AI safety constraints through specially crafted inputs

### Gap 2: Complexity in internal executions

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

#### Overview
This gap concerns vulnerabilities within the AI agent's internal processing systems. Research in this area examines how the inherent complexity of AI models can lead to security issues, unexpected behaviors, and exploitable patterns.

#### Key Sub-Categories:

- **Backdoor Attacks**: Research on hidden functionalities inserted into models during training
- **Hallucination**: Studies on AI systems generating false or misleading information
- **Misalignment**: Research on disparities between intended and actual AI behavior
- **Planning Risk**: Materials on risks from AI planning capabilities
- **Tools Use Risk**: Research on vulnerabilities when AI systems use external tools

### Gap 3: Variability of operational environments

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

#### Overview
This gap examines how different operational contexts can introduce security vulnerabilities. Research in this area focuses on how environmental factors can impact AI safety and create novel attack vectors.

#### Key Sub-Categories:

- **Indirect Prompt Injection**: Research on indirect manipulation of AI systems through environmental inputs
- **Reinforcement Learning Environment Threats**: Studies on exploiting RL training environments
- **Simulated & Sandbox Environment Threats**: Research on vulnerabilities in testing environments
- **Computing Resource Management Threats**: Materials on resource-based attacks and vulnerabilities  
- **Physical Environment Threats**: Research on exploiting AI through manipulation of physical surroundings

</details>

### Gap 4: Interactions with untrusted external entities

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

#### Overview
This gap addresses risks arising from AI systems interacting with external systems, services, and other AI agents. Research in this area explores vulnerabilities from interactions with potentially malicious or compromised external entities.

#### Key Sub-Categories:

- **Cooperative Risk**: Materials on vulnerabilities when AI systems collaborate with other systems
- **Competitive Risk**: Research on security issues when AI systems compete or conflict with others
- **Long-term Memory Threats**: Studies on vulnerabilities in persistent AI memory systems
- **Short-term Memory Threats**: Research on exploiting temporary memory structures in AI systems
